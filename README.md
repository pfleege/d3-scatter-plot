## About

D3 Scatter Plot demo shows how the D3.js library can be used to visualize data. In the scatter plot demo, we have used the well-known Iris flower data set from the 1930's paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems".

By selecting a combination of features to view on the x-axis and y-axis, we can see that the different species have specific characteristics, which in turn makes it possible to set them apart based on the length and width of their leaves.
